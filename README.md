Baby's first Vue project! Thanks to [Theo](https://tmb.sh/) for the idea of encoding data in base64 in the URL... Otherwise it would've been baby's first full-stack project ðŸ˜³

Bugs:

- Make "CUSTOMIZE" text clickable as toggle
- Button text updating works but is not Vue idiomatic
- The first view should be the default words (I think), even if the encoded data has other `value` values set
- Validate synonyms (no empty ones, probably no repeats either)
